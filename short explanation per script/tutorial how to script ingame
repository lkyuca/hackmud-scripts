i will provide a quick tutorial how to start any script ingame.

>>scripts.user
<script name>

>>#edit <script name>
#be sure after editing to save it locally for example in visual studio in your folder
>>#up <script name>
# #up command makes sure your script is not to many characters and can run you want this to be the result example: Success FULLSEC PRIVATE  84 / 2.000 chars (4,20%)
>><user>.<script name>
# here an example :>>vexfica.vexingsim

#i recommand trying this out with the message script since its very easy to check if it works since you have a message in the chat
