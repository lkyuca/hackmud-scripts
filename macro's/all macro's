you can just paste these in you terminal to make them
if you want to use them for example kernel.hardline you type in the terminal :/hl
its that simple 

Creating a macro is done with the format /macro = original.script. Pre-defined parameters can also be applied. For example:

/hl = kernel.hardline
/dc = kernel.hardline { dc:true }
/b = accts.balance
/c = chats.send {{ channel:"{0}",msg:{1} }}

To delete an existing macro, type /macro = with nothing after the =.

>>/hl =
Macro deleted.
